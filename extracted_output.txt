enjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one 
of you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, 
academics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, 
home makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent 
community who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at 
Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my 
online interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the 
following important messages: 
 
1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, 
 
2. Empower villages, 
 
3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, 
 
4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth

6. Overcome problems through partnership, 
 
7. Courage in combating calamities, 
 
8. Connectivity for societal transformation, 
 
9. Defending the nation: Our pride and 
 
10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. 
 
Now let me share with you each of the messages. 
 
Accelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth 
While there were many significant events during my tenure, a question from a little girl 
Anukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, 
during children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever 
after. 
 
Anukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I 
appreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and assured her that 
that her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work

for it to achieve before 2020. This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed 
India has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over 
fifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 
million youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and 
proud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. 
 
Empower Villages 
Friends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming 
office as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal 
village council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of 
village citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with 
financial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and 
vegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in 
Nagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages 
to the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which 
can take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal 
with their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban 
societies. 
 
Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness 
Now I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of 
Technology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas 
(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes 
provision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to 
economic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate 
level education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale 
employment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support 
of 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a 
cultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and 
medicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all 
running marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the 
whole region. 
 
During the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported 
by Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts 
from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core 
competence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed 
internationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO 
specialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture 
has enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to 
develop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of 
PURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to 
bridging the rural – urban divide. 
 
Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth

Let me now share with you, the enriching experience I had, whil e meeting more than 
6000 farmers from different States and Union Territories visitin g Rashtrapati Bhavan. 
They evinced keen interest in the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens , the Spiritual 
Garden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden and interact 
with the Horticultural specialists. Recently, during my address to the agricultural 
scientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I 
summarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the 
agricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced 
manpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of 
“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the 
farmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the 
Scientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence 
that the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum 
through the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly 
for value addition. 
 
Defeat the problems and succeed 
On the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautiful experience. 
As I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was 
in sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands 
and legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself 
as Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had 
happened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, 
teachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what 
I could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont 
of you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti 
entharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. 
What is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music 
could blossom in this 
person with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, 
academics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of 
course, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art 
theatre. 
 
Overcome the impact of disaster through partnership 
I had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of 
Jammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in 
2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  
Western Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of 
that area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. 
I met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of 
their losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations 
along with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating 
their problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than 
allowing problems to become their master. Despite the severe l oss due to the earthquake,

the children and the members of the village participated in the reli ef operation with the 
Armed Forces 
bravely and were smiling when I went to meet them. They interacted with me and said 
that the school was functional in the temporary tents. Here, I also witnessed the 
participation of acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir along with State Government 
authorities in on-the-spot settlement of relief grants to be provide d to the victims whose 
houses had been damaged in the earth quake. I have experienced many s uch acts of 
courage from our citizens when faced with severe challenges. 
 
Courage in combating calamities 
In 2005, I met the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, Children of Chuckchucha village 
during my visit to Car Nicobar Islands. While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation 
activities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I 
realized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many 
human losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken 
possession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in 
Car-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea 
Waves” which reads as follows: 
Sea Waves 
 
We are the children of Sea waves, 
Sea waves are my friends. 
When they become angry, 
Sea waves give the challenges. 
God has given the courage, 
To challenge the sea waves. 
And we will succeed, 
We will succeed 
With Almighty’s grace. 
All the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem with me and exhibited 
lots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering 
during the Tsunami. 
 
Connectivity for societal transformation 
I addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johannesburg, South 
Africa. This was attended by 53 member countries of the Africa n Union, where I 
proposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated 
satellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an 
estimated cost of US $ 100 million. 
 
As part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa), 17 Super 
Specialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-me dicine centers and 53 
tele-education centres in Africa will be connected. The pilot project on tele-education and 
tele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned. Indira Gandh i National Open 
University has taken up the MBA Course for 34 Ethiopian students of Addis  Ababa and 
Harmaya Universities. As regards, tele-medicine, the special ists from CARE Hospital,

Hyderabad are providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in B lack Lion 
Hospital, Addis Ababa in Cardiology and Radiology since November 2006. Using the 
Pan African network the Heads of the State in all the 53 countries  will be connected for 
instant communication. I am extremely happy that Indian experience  in bringing the 
benefits of technology to the people has enabled us to work with Afric a to bring societal 
transformation in the African continent. 
 
Defending the nation: Our pride 
I visited KUMAR in Siachen Glacier located at 17,000 feet altitude held by the Indian 
Army, had a memorable underwater journey in INS Sindhurakshak and flew  in a Sukhoi-
30 fighter experiencing 2.5 g. In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our 
ever vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of 
their duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last 
five years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in 
number of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace 
missions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence 
Forces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our 
Defence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The 
Nation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. 
Similarly, I had opportunities to interact 
with members of our para-military forces, central and state police personnel including 
internal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety 
and security of our citizens under difficult conditions. 
 
Youth movement for Developed India 2020 
Recently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting into practice the motto 
of transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation 
created by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of s tudents in many 
districts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Adm inistration. Particularly, I 
happened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students  of 
Medak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is 
visible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage 
fear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student 
leader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she 
weaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from 
the Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country 
are on the right path 
through this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the 540 million 
youth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, 
under the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based 
education and leadership. 
 
Conclusion 
I was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of the tune, cultural 
diversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours. I have cited thes e examples just to 
give a glimpse of the richness of our tradition and effort being taken by different agencies

to preserve it. There are also many new adventures by instituti ons and individuals. I have 
experienced many of them and learnt a lot about my country and our peopl e. Even while 
pursuing our economic growth, we need to do a lot to preserve the rich and diverse 
treasures of our culture and civilization. It is our duty for our fut ure generations. This has 
to be done in a much larger scale through countrywide participatio n of multiple 
institutions. Our country is blessed with natural resources, has shown c onsiderable 
progress in the last sixty years, and above all we have hard wor king people particularly 
the power of the 540 million youth of the country. Every sector of our count ry has given 
me the 
confidence that India can become a developed nation well before 2020. Whomsoever, I 
met they constantly ask what they can give to the nation. We should c onstantly strive to 
empower such members of the society. With this spirit, I am extr emely happy that we are 
on the right path. Here I am reminded of a famous poem: 
"When you wish upon a star, 
Makes no difference who you are, 
Anything your heart desires, 
Will come to you” 
This poem is true to all of us, and particularly for our youth and if they aim great, I am 
sure they will reach close to the target or the target. 
 
My dear citizens, let us resolve to continue to work for realizing the missions of 
developed India 2020 with the following distinctive profile. 
 
1. A Nation where the rural and urban divide has reduced to a thin line. 
 
2. A Nation where there is an equitable distribution and adequate access to energy and 
quality water. 
 
3. A Nation where agriculture, industry and service sector work together in symphony. 
 
4. A Nation where education with value system is not denied to any meritorious 
candidates because of societal or economic discrimination. 
 
5. A Nation which is the best destination for the most talented scholars, scientists, and 
investors. 
 
6. A Nation where the best of health care is available to all. 
 
7. A Nation where the governance is responsive, transparent and corruption free. 
 
8. A Nation where poverty has been totally eradicated, illiteracy removed and crimes 
against women and children are absent and none in the society feels alienated. 
 
9. A Nation that is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful and happy and continues with a 
sustainable growth path.

10. A Nation that is one of the best places to live in and is proud of its leadership. 
 
Finally let me thank each one of you for showering your love and affection on me 
throughout the last five years by your cooperation and support. 
 
Dear Citizens, I conclude my address by sharing with you my mission in life which is to 
bring connectivity between billion hearts and minds of the people of Indi a in our 
multicultural society and to embed the self confidence that "we c an do it". I will be 
always with you, dear citizens, in the great mission of making Indi a a developed nation 
before 2020. 
 
May God bless you. 
 
Jai hind.
